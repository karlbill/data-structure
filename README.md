# Data Structure
Some studies about Data Structures and how to implement the Collection Interface in Java.

## Collection Interface
Root-interface from where Set, Queue and List are derived.

#### Set
Doesn't have any duplicated element

#### List
Ordered collection that can contain duplicated elements

#### Queue
First-in, First-out

## Vector Class
Class from where Stack derives.

#### Stack
Last-in, First-out

## Map Interface
Key-value association, where keys are uniques.

#### HashMap
HashMap implements Map and it is not synchronous. It is possible to have null keys and null values.

#### HashTable
HashTable implements Map and it is synchronous. Null values and null keys are forbidden.

### SortedMap
This interface extends Map and keeps the keys in classified sorting.

#### TreeMap
TreeMap implements Sorted Map. The elements are storaged as trees.
